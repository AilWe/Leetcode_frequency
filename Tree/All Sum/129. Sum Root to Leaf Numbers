129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
Given a binary tree containing digits from 0-9 only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path 1->2->3 which represents the number 123.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.
class Solution {
public:
    int sumNumbers(TreeNode* root) {
        int sum = 0;
        int total = 0;
        Sum(root, sum, total);
        return total;
        
    }
    void Sum(TreeNode* root, int &sum, int &total){
        if(root == NULL) return;
        if(root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL) {
            total = total+sum*10+root->val;
            return;
        };
        sum = sum*10+root->val;
        Sum(root->left, sum, total);
        Sum(root->right, sum, total);
        sum = (sum-root->val)/10;
    }
};

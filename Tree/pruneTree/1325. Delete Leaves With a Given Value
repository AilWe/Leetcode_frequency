1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value
Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if it's parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you can't).
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* removeLeafNodes(TreeNode* root, int target) {
        if(root == NULL) return root;
        root->left = removeLeafNodes(root->left, target);
        root->right = removeLeafNodes(root->right, target);
        if(root->val == target && root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL) return NULL;
        return root;
    }
};

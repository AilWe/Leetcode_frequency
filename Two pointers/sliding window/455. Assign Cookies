455. Assign Cookies
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number
//O(mlogm + nlogn)
class Solution {
public:
    int findContentChildren(vector<int>& g, vector<int>& s) {
        sort(g.begin(), g.end()); // O(glog(g))
        sort(s.begin(), s.end());//O(mlog(m))
        int ans = 0;
        int j = 0;
        for(int r: g){//O(g)+O(m)
            while(j<s.size() && s[j]<r){
                ++j;
            }
            if(j<s.size()){
                ++ans;
                ++j;
                continue;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

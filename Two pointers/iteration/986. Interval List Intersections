986. Interval List Intersections
Given two lists of closed intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

(Formally, a closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.  The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that is either empty, or can be represented as a closed interval.  For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].)

        vector<vector<int>> ans;
        while(i< A.size() && j<B.size()){
            const int s = max(A[i].front(), B[j].front());
            const int e = min(A[i].back(), B[j].back());
            if(s<=e) ans.push_back({s,e});

70. Climbing Stairs
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        //f[i] = climbStairs(i)
        vector<int> f(n+1, 0);
        //f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2]
        f[0] = 1;
        f[1] = 1;
        
        for(int i=2; i<=n; ++i)
            f[i] = f[i-1]+f[i-2];
        return f[n];
    }
};

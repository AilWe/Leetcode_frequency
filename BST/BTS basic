Depth First Search (DFS)
  Depth as the priority
  Start from a root and reach all the way down to certain leaf, then back to root to reach another branch
  Can be separated as preorder, inorder and postorder
Breadth First Search (BFS)
  Scan through the tree level by level
  Following the order of height, from top to bottom
Inorder traversal of BTS ia an array sorted in the ascending order
  It is height-balanced

/*Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

//Preorder Traversal: Always Choose Left Middle Node as a Root
//Preorder Traversal: Always Choose Right Middle Node as a Root
//
Approach 3: Preorder Traversal: Choose Random Middle Node as a Root
